## Projects:
1. Individual assignment: From basic image processing towards object detection
The goal of this individual assignment is to apply some basic image processing techniques to detect an object and produce a one minute video.

2. Group assignment: Crafting and learning features
The goal of this assignment is to explore more advanced techniques for constructing features that better describe objects of interest and perform a few tasks using these features. The final notebook is exported as .ipynb .

3. Final project: In the name of deep learning
In the final project, we delve into applying deep learning techniques to computer vision problems. In the first part, we train model from scratch, an then via Fine-Tuning. Next, we find the weaknesses of the classification model (utilize White-Box Attack on the model).
