        "\n",
        "In the first phase, keypoints are detected at different scales of the image. This is done through a blob detection algorithm that is based on finding extrema of the Laplacian of the Gaussian-filtered image. These extrema are found at a certain characteristic scale $\\sigma$ of the Gaussian which denotes the size of the region at which the blob is most pronounced. This detection in scale-space is the reason why the features are scale-invariant, as the same keypoint can be detected and described at a different scale after a scaling transformation. Moreover, because the Laplacian operation is rotationally invariant, so will be the feature points.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step results in many detected keypoints in position-scale space. In order to only retain the most prominent and robust keypoints for increased accuracy and efficiency, in the second step, we require that the contrast at the keypoint is high enough. For translation invariance, we also don't want keypoints to be on edges. However, the Laplacian response will often be high on edges. A classic approach is to look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix at the position and the scale of a keypoint. It is well-known that in a corner-like structure, the eigenvalues will both be large (indicating the large change in both the x- and y-direction), whereas for an edge, only one eigenvalue is large. We only retain the keypoint when the ratio of the larger to the smaller eigenvalue is sufficiently small.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the remaining keypoints, a (SIFT) descriptor is constructed based on the gradient information in a neighbourhood around the keypoint (usually a $16 \\times 16$ patch). This patch is divided into 16 $4 \\times 4$ patches, where a histogram of gradients is constructed over 8 directions. This process results in a $4 * 4 * 8 = 128$-dimensional keypoint descriptor. The orientation of the gradients is determined with respect to a dominant gradient direction in the larger patch, which makes the descriptor rotation-invariant. We can threshold the numbers for illumination invariance. The histogram (binning) results in increased robustness to noise. The descriptor is, to a certain extent, also invariant to affine transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, images can be compared by executing this process for both images and trying to match keypoints (descriptors) to detect whether an object (or in our case: a face) in the first image is also present in the second image. Matching can be based on a common distance measure such as the Euclidean distance."

        "The general method of PCA has also been applied for analyzing images of faces. Images can be transformed into a suitable vector representation by considering each colour channel of each pixel as a separate component. For example, a $100 \\times 100$ image results in a vector of $100 * 100 * 3 = 30000$ components. *image_to_vec* and *vec_to_image* achieve this transformation.\n",

Second, the previously discussed eigenvalue problem is solved. In this context, the returned principal components are called eigenfaces. The most important eigenfaces capture the most salient characteristics of the training faces.\n",

        "Finally, we can project a new face onto the calculated principal component subspace and reconstruct the face from this lower-dimensional representation. Calculating the dot product between the face vector and the principal components gives us the projection of the face in the lower-dimensional subspace. The PCA method makes sure that this is done in an optimal way in the sense that we lose as little information as possible when performing this dimensionality reduction.\n",

We see that increasing the number of dimensions indeed reduces the error, and most significantly so with the first few eigenfaces. In this case, apparently, the third eigenface of person A captures some important characteristics of the test image, as the mean squared error drops the most and the image changes visually when we include that dimension. With a very aggressive dimensionality reduction, this may be the optimal number of components to take into account. Although the reconstruction is obviously not complete with the first 15 principal components, consider already the quality of the result with only 15 of $256 * 256 * 3 = 196608$ dimensions. Also note that we have a very challenging problem, as the training and test faces don't appear in a very uniform way that is optimal for PCA (faces turned, rotated, object partially in front of the face, high variance in the background, ...)."

        "**SIFT.** \n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of SIFT features, and the reason for which they were designed,  is their invariance properties with respect to rotation, scaling and affine transformations. While the images of the same person in our dataset are quite heterogeneous, there are still some notable differences in appearance, illumination, background and pose. The strength of the invariance properties of SIFT features is shown in the fact that we could achieve very good classification and identification performance on the test images of persons A and B. However, SIFT does struggle with occlusions and large shadows, this can be seen in the test image of person A where he is holding an object in front of his face, this image is always wrongly classified. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is also not necessary to have a large dataset for feature extraction; SIFT is a general and readily applicable technique that can immediately be used on individual images.\n",
        "\n",
        "This final point is also a disadvantage. Because SIFT is not data-driven, the feature space that it produces cannot be optimized for a specific task or a specific set of instances. This can be seen in the significatntly worse classification accuracy for persons C and D. The features of these persons are not constructed in the context of the appearances of persons A and B, making it difficult to immediately match them and assign person C to A and D to B. The features are constructed in isolation and appear to differ significantly. Also, SIFT is quite computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PCA.** \n",
        "\n",
        "PCA is very efficient in the sense that we can achieve a very strong dimensionality reduction, while keeping the discriminative power to classify images reasonably well. We also have flexibility in the number of principal components to retain. It slightly improves classification performance over the SIFT features, and importantly, it does so with a large reduction in the number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "The disadvantage is that for PCA to really work well, training and test images need to have a very coherent appearance. We perform an alignment step to reduce the variance between the images, but differences in pose, clothes, background... still significantly decrease performance. Also, the training set we use does not allow us to push the limits of the performance we can achieve, as we would need more training images to be able to increase the useful number of principal components. Using a large dataset of specifically tailored images for PCA would allow us to really assess the quality of this technique, which could be an extension when we had more time. While this reduces the robustness and usability of this technique, it is still interesting that we can achieve quite good results on a difficult task for PCA with very few features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transfer learning.** \n",
        "\n",
        "It is clear that transfer learning is by far the best approach we have used in this project. It performs perfectly in all ways. This is because we can use an extensive neural network that has the possibility to very flexibly learn all kinds of latent characteristics that are present in the images. This results in a projection of the images to a very discriminative, optimized feature representation for the task of person identification. A disadvantage is that we need an enormous amount of data to train the network, but transfer learning alleviates this issue by leveraging a pretrained network where this has already been done.\n",
        "\n",
        "**General conclusions.** \n",
        "\n",
        "As a general assessment of the performance of the difference methods, the most significant difference between handcrafted and data-driven features is that handcrafted features are constructed in isolation and only afterwards used to distinguish between the images. SIFT features are generally designed to be as robust and discriminative as possible, but they aren’t explicitly optimized for a particular set of instances or for a particular task during construction. This makes it difficult for them to generalize well, as the projection of images to feature space is not learned in the context of relations that exist between images.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the data-driven methods perform projections of images to a feature space that is explicitly learned to be as discriminative as possible for a particular set of instances. This means that data-driven methods are more performant because they perform the tasks of classification and identification in a space that is flexibly learned to be optimal in some way to distinguish between a particular set of images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, transfer learning outperforms PCA. Transfer learning performs better than PCA because PCA learns a feature space that is optimized with respect to the statistical measure of variance, whereas transfer learning projects images to a space that is optimized with respect to arbitrary latent characteristics of the images under consideration. This makes transfer learning more flexible than PCA because it is not restricted to only dealing with variance and it has a lot of freedom to learn something optimal for the task at hand. This is a major advantage of deep learning and it is the reason why it has been so popular in recent years.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional remarks and possible improvements**\n",
        "\n",
        "The previous section provides a detailed discussion on each of the feature representations and their relative strengths and weaknesses. In this final section we go a bit further and try to explore some ways in which our feature representation and therefore the classifier could be further improved. We also look at some possible pitfalls when using this system as a security face identification system.\n",
        " \n",
        "Due to the limited time-frame in which this assignment had to be completed, we did not get to implement all our ideas to improve the system. To improve the performance of the SIFT feature algorithm it would be interesting to implement SURF (Bay et al., 2006) or ORB (Rublee et al., 2011). To add color invariance to the SIFT features we could also implement CSIFT (Abdel-Hakim & Farag, 2006).\n",
        "\n",
        "Various improvements are still possible/necessary to our most performant feature representation: the transfer learning features, especially to make it function properly as a company security system. At the moment, the dataset is very small and only contains two people. Therefore, the network will predict either person A or person B when presented with a picture. In a real-world setting this is undesirable, we need a third class with faces and even objects that are ‘not known’. An efficient way of training this third class is to use our moving window implementation. By applying our moving window algorithm to different pictures that are very crowded, we will have at once a large number of false positives on which the network can be retrained. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another necessary step is to make the network more robust to adversarial attacks. One way of doing this has already been mentioned, namely creating a larger dataset. However, it has been shown that this alone is not enough. The reason for this is that, even with a large dataset, the machine learning models are only trained on a small subset of the whole feature space. The high-dimensional feature space, especially in image analysis, is so sparse that most of the training data is located only in a small region; this region is referred to as the manifold. Therefore, the network can be fooled by creating images that fall outside of the manifold. This can be done by something as simple as wearing glasses with a specific pattern (Sharif et al., 2016).  Knowing this, specific datasets have to be used to test the robustness of the network and improve it. An example of such a dataset is Damagenet which was created for the ImageNet dataset and able to fool many models trained on the dataset (Chen et al., 2019)\n",
